 Call this method to assign a rank to a 7-card hand. Each card is an integer from 0 (Ace of Spades), 1 (Ace of Hearts) to 51 (Two of Clubs). For performance
 reasons this method does nothing to verify that the input is a valid hand, the responsibility for this rests entirely with the caller. The ranks are all
 positive, and the highest rank is 7462. The set of all 7-card ranks is not an interval from 1: the worst 7-card poker hand has a rank of 49. Still, the
 higher the rank the stronger the hand, and two hands of equal rank always draw. Valid hands, i.e. 7-tuples of pairwise distinct integers from 0 to 51
 inclusive, don't need to be sorted.
 <p>
 It's helpful to think of the ranks as living on an interval which has been mapped onto a circle whose circumference is a constant, like thread round a
 cotton wheel. The circumference is chosen so that no two ranks overlap. This trick cuts the RAM cost by 40%, to 9MB, with negligible cost in performance.
 <p>
 The method now works as follows. First, it looks up a pre-calculated 32-bit integer card key for each of the seven parameters and adds these all together
 to generate a <i>hand key</i>. It then breaks up the hand key in two pieces, one a 23-bit integer (the <i>face key</i>) and the other a 9-bit integer (the
 <i>flush check key</i>), using bitshifts and masks. We look up the value in the flushCheck array placed (flush check key)th. This value is either a suit
 value, the suit of the flush in the event the suit is a flush of some kind, or a common non-suit value otherwise.
 <p>
 Usually, about 97% of the time, the hand does not contain a flush. If the hand is not a flush we replace the face key with its value modulo the circumference
 constant. We look up the entry in the rankArray whose index is this new face key. The value we find is exactly the rank, in the event the hand is not a
 flush. Otherwise, if the hand is a flush, we form a new <i>flush key</i> for the hand (the sum of five, six or seven non-zero integers). We look up the
 value positioned (flush key)th in the flushRankArray. This is the rank of the hand, in the event it's a flush.
 <p>
 Typically this method will return the rank of a valid 7-card hand with no more than 6 additions.
 <p>
 When applying this to equity calculations we recommend taking the method as a block of code and developing it into a custom method. This saves method calls
 which, while not costly individually, accumulate to appreciably hamper performance. Specific applications also often have their own combinatorics which you
 can exploit.
